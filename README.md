# The influence of the Italian press on 2018 politics

This project, carried out together with my colleagues **Matteo Anedda**, **Greta Gravina** and **Giada Palazzo**, consists in the study and the visualization of the correlations between the result of the Italian political elections of 4 March 2018 and the influence of the press, understood as social interactions and most clicked sites and news.

The project was carried out using both **Python** and the **Tableau** platform, combining everything in a single tableau public dashboard.

Check out the visualization here (use a PC or a laptop): https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/niccol.3340/viz/Linfluenzadellastampaitalianasulrisultatodel4Marzo/Titolo.

Furthermore, in this repo you can find a png file containing an **optional** visualization carried out individually during the related course: a scatterplot concerning the relationship between weather and the clinical condition of severe patients.
